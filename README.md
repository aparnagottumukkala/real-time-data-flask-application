# Django/Flask Programming Question:
Shows real-time data on a browser, i.e. whenever there is any change/addition reflected on the database, it should be reflected in the browser.
# Conditions that need to meet
  ● This program should not use any update/refresh call from the browser side.
  ● You can use any external packages such as Celery or Websockets to implement this.
  ● You do not have to create a database for this task; the program only needs to obtain the
  data from some source.
  ● You can assume the data in the database is a temperature data of a sensor which
  receives value every 10 seconds from a source.
  ● The data could be displayed over a table or graph (whichever is easier for you).
